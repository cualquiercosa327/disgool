problems:

1) no function call statement appears for 0x27
3) no function call statement appears for:
   - msc pso 10 sso 1?
   -     pso 11 sso 3?
   -     pso 12 sso 2?
   -     pso 10 sso 1
   ** msc pso 7 works fine
4) last statement in second to last block (else if) of func_10c (boxsc.gooc)
   belongs to its parent block
5) where is the end of sub_44c?
6) no condition for RST op in 0x6B0
9) while conditions are wrong b/c they try to pop the stack of stuff before it
   is even present

format issues:

1) binary expressions extra parenthesis in an if statement
2) readglobal has comma but it only takes single argument
